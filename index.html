        <h2 class ="section-header">About Us</h2>
        <p>I, Ephraim Acquah, and my Girlfriend, Aliya Kaufman-Daniel, have been together for over a year and a half now, going on 
           two years this coming March, and our relationship, through its ups and downs, has been nothing short of a blessing. We 
           are both 20 years old, with Aliya being older than I by just over 4 months, but that doesn't stop us from acting as 
           equal partners and best of friends. We're both from the DMV area, yet surprisingly enough we didn't run into each 
           other until the second half of the '21-'22 school year in college. We got together in college and have tried our best 
           to be the epitome of love for each other. Funnily enough, this is something that our peers have noticed, and we 
           have a lot of friends and strangers who look fondly upon our relationship and wish us nothing but the best. We plan 
           to one day get married, but of course take every step of our relationship one day at a time, not rushing anything. We 
           both have support systems in place that help us move our relationship forward and achieve all the goals that we have 
           in the future for our relationship. Overall, we're really just looking to make the most of the God-given opportunity 
           we have to love each other.</p>

    <!--This section of the webpage is a lot like the first, but it is instead about the backstory between Aliya and I's relationship-->
    <div id="backstory">
        <h2 class="section-header">Backstory</h2>
        <p>Aliya and I first met online through Instagram back in December of 2021. The next month, early in January, I noticed 
           that she had liked one of my Instagram posts. The post she liked was a very old one, my senior photos from high school
           in fact. When I first saw it I didn't think much of it, I just let it be. On January 8th, I was in Boston with the basketball
           team because we had a game against Boston University. After the game, I saw again the notification for her having liked my old
           Instagram picture, and decided that I would send her a DM about it. So I did. The conversation went well, and we exchanged
           Snapchat handles. For the next couple of weeks, we talked and got to know each other over Snapchat. We learned that we
           lived in the same residence hall as well as talked about each other's backgrounds and interests, everything you could
           think of when getting to know someone in a romantic way. Even though we were talking so much, the undertone of romance 
           was just that. A slight undertone. It wasn't until later on in the month, January 20th that we hung out in person for the 
           first time. The first time we spent time together was in her dorm. I came over in the evening and didn't leave until around 
           1 am. During that time we had a really nice conversation, and I was able to get a glimpse into the subtle things that made 
           Aliya different from others in my mind. She showed me the different collections she had, such as her artwork and stickers, 
           and we got to know each other some more in person. Over the course of the next two weeks, we hung out one other time, and 
           it went a lot like the first time. Then, on January 28th, we went to a party with both of our roommates, me with my roommates 
           and her with her roommates. This day would be the day that would define us as a couple for the rest of time. From that 
           day onwards we hung out almost every day and were more officially in the talking stage where it was clear that we liked 
           each other. As we were in the talking stage, we hit a rocky stage and we also joined the Konpa team individually as 
           something to try out. We eventually ended up paired, and dancing together has grown into something we both enjoy. It was 
           what brought us out of this troubling time in our talking stage, and on March 7, 2022, I asked Aliya to be my girlfriend. 
           Ever since then, we've done a lot of things together as we've grown in love, life, and relationship together.</p>
